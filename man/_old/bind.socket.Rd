\title{
Create an endpoint for accepting connections and bind it to the socket referenced by the socket argument.
}
\description{
The zmq_bind() function shall create an endpoint for accepting connections and bind it to the socket referenced by the socket argument.

The endpoint argument is a string consisting of two parts as follows: transport ://address. The transport part specifies the underlying transport protocol to use. The meaning of the address part is specific to the underlying transport protocol selected.

The following transports are defined:

inproc
local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport, see zmq_inproc(7)
ipc
local inter-process communication transport, see zmq_ipc(7)
tcp
unicast transport using TCP, see zmq_tcp(7)
pgm, epgm
reliable multicast transport using PGM, see zmq_pgm(7)
With the exception of ZMQ_PAIR sockets, a single socket may be connected to multiple endpoints using zmq_connect(), while simultaneously accepting incoming connections from multiple endpoints bound to the socket using zmq_bind(). Refer to zmq_socket(3) for a description of the exact semantics involved when connecting or binding a socket to multiple endpoints.

\usage{
bind.socket(socket, address)
}
\arguments{
  \item{socket}{a zmq socket object.}
  \item{address}{a transport as described above.}
}
\value{TRUE if operation succeeds or FALSE if the operation fails}
